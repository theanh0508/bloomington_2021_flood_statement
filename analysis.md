# Public summary
Intense rainfall and flooding occurred in Bloomington, IN overnight on June 18--19, 2021.  The event was caused by a massive complex of thunderstorms that parked over the Bloomington, IN area for over 8 hours.  Preliminary reports show that the system delivered 5--7 inches of rain, which puts the event in the top 3 recorded in the region: possibly the highest recorded.  Regional trends over the last century show an increase in extreme rainfall like this event, which is consistent with fundamental Atmospheric Science theories and climate model simulations of ongoing and future climate change.

# Analysis
The sections below give a more thorough analysis of the June 18--19, 2021 flood event in Bloomington, IN. 

## Meteorological conditions
The flood was caused by a large amount of precipitation from a [mesoscale convective system (MCS)](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Mesoscale_convective_system) associated with a [quasi-stationary front](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Quasi-stationary_front) (see NWS analysis map below).  The MCS strengthened overnight on June 18 and remained stationary; precipitation from the storm continued through June 19.  A weather station in Bloomington, IN recorded over 10,000 lightning strikes within a 30 mile radius overnight.

[Local weather observers](https://maps.cocorahs.org/?maptype=precip&units=us&base=std&cp=BluYlwRed&datetype=daily&displayna=0&date=2021-06-19&key=dynamic&overlays=state,county&bbox=-87.06115722656251,38.9524673652846,-86.0723876953125,39.3995914050189) recorded 5--7 inches of rainfall within a 24 hour period.

**Caption** Surface analysis from the [National Weather Service](https://weather.gov) analyzed at approximately 11pm Eastern Friday June 18, 2021.

The MCS was associated with abnormally high amounts of instability in the atmosphere, temperatures ~10 F above normal, and strong south winds that brought additional water vapor from the Gulf of Mexico.  The system produced multiple rounds of thunderstorms with intense rainfall rates, which all developed and moved in a "training" pattern continually over the same locations (mostly along highway 46, from Terre Haute to Bloomington)

## Historical records
![Historical analysis of Bloomington rainfall](bloomington_rx1day_19Jun2021.png)
**Caption** Annual maximum daily precipitation rates for Bloomington, IN from 1895 to 2020.  An estimate of the June 18--19, 2021 flood event total, based on preliminary data from [CoCoRaHS](https://maps.cocorahs.org/?maptype=precip&units=us&base=std&cp=BluYlwRed&datetype=daily&displayna=0&date=2021-06-19&key=dynamic&overlays=state,county&bbox=-87.06115722656251,38.9524673652846,-86.0723876953125,39.3995914050189), is shown as the shaded crimson bar at the right of the graph.  

As the above graph shows, the event ranks somewhere between the 1st--3rd highest daily total on record. It is possibly the highest 24 hour rainfall observed on record; we will know more once the local observation is quality-contolled by the National Center for Environmental Information.


![Trends in extreme rainfall in IN](extreme_trend_fig.png)

**Caption** Extreme precipitation in Indiana (the top 1% of days of precipitation), which for Bloomington is approximately 1" of rain in a day, have increased substantially since 1900. During the early to mid part of the 20th century, we would have 1-3 such days in a year but we now experience as many as 8 per year. Plot from [INCCIA report](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/inccia/).  


![Map of 24 hour rain rates from the CoCoRaHS network](cocorahs_jun182021.png)

Several CoCoRaHS sites near Ellettsville had over 5" of rain in the last 24 hours, with one logging 7.42". Nearly all of that occurred within a 6-hour (or shorter) period, so a <0.01 probability of annual occurrence (100+ yr event; see (https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_map_cont.html?bkmrk=in)[https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_map_cont.html?bkmrk=in]). Simple interpolation of those data would place Bloomington around 5" (MC airport did not report hourly precip overnight, so it would be nice to see radar estimates too).


## Did climate change cause this event?
This is a common question about disasters caused by extreme weather events, however it is an ill-posed question, since extreme weather events like this can and have (in the past) happened in the absence of climate change.  Here are a couple alternate, well-posed questions with answers that are backed by a host peer-reviewed literature:

### Have we observed changes in extreme rainfall like this?
Analysis of precipitation observations shows that the intensity of the 20 year storm (a storm so strong it is only likely to happen once every 20 years) may have increased by approximately 10% over the last century over Indiana (Risser et al., 2019).  The short record makes it difficult to distinguish this trend from noise in the data.  The increasing trend is consistent with theoretical expectations and with climate model simulations (IPCC 2014 and references within), which builds confidence that the observed trend is real and not a statistical artifact.

### How might floods like this change in the future?
Climate model simulations indicate that climate change will (1) increase the frequency of MCS, (2)  cause MCS to cover larger areas, and (3)  to deliver more rainfall in total (Prein et al., 2017).  The overall effect is an increase in the volume of precipitation from these distruptive systems, consistent with the large amount of rainfall delivered over the Bloomington area in the June 18-19, 2021 flood.
